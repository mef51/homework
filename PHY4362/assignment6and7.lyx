 What parameters contribute to the four factor formula and what is its physical
 meaning?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four factor formula is 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\infty}=\eta fp\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and represents the criticality of a nuclear chain reaction in an infinite
 medium.
 The four factors are called 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eta & : & \mathrm{reproduction\, factor}\\
f & : & \mathrm{thermal\, utilization\, factor}\\
p & : & \mathrm{resonance\, escape\, probability}\\
\epsilon & : & \mathrm{fast\, fission\, factor}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 represents the # of fission neutrons produced per absorption in the fuel.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the probability that an absorbed neutron is absorbed in the fuel material.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the fraction of fission neutrons that slow down to thermal energies
 without being absorbed.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of the total number of fission neutrons to the number of thermal
 fission neutrons (?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series default
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k>1$
\end_inset

, the reaction is supercritical and will grow exponentially.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k<1$
\end_inset

 it is subcritical and will decay exponentially.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 is it critical and the neutron population remains constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\series default
 The size of the graphite rods is determined by the diffusion length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{d}$
\end_inset

 which is the distance thermal neutrons travels on average before absorption
 and the slowing distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{s}$
\end_inset

 which is the distance a fast neutron travels before slowing down.
 The size is also determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and the complete reproduction factor 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 which takes into account the fraction of fast and thermal neutrons that
 leave the system 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{f}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{t}$
\end_inset

.

\series default
 Fission bombs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
i)
\series default
 Explain the difference between the first plutonium and uranium bombs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first uranium bomb was a gun type bomb where a plug of uranium-235 was
 fired into a pellet of uranium-235, causing the mass to go supercritical.
 The first plutonium bomb was an implosion bomb, where a sphere of plutonium
 is compressed to criticality by chemical explosions surrounding it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
ii)
\series default
 What is the role of a U238 tamper in the plutonium bomb design?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The U238 tamper surrounds the plutonium mass and reflects neutrons back
 into the core and provides a little extra neutrons to the reaction.
\end_layout

 What is the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It refers to the Russian 'layered' design where fusion and fission fuel
 are layered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series default
 What are neutron bombs and salted bombs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutron bombs are meant to primarily release a lethal pulse of neutron radiation
 as opposed to explosive destruction.
 This is meant to clear an area of people by killing them with radiation
 while largely preserving buildings and structures.
 The fallout and the explosion are relatively small compared to other nuclear
 weapons and the primary killer is the neutron radiation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Salted bombs are nuclear weapons that maximize nuclear fallout and are used
 to make an area uninhabitable by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

salting
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 it with dangerous radioactive waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series default
 What percentage of the destructive power of a typical 10MT nuclear device
 comes from actual fusion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Less than half.
 Most of the power comes from the extra fission of Uranium that the fusion
 causes.
\end_layout

 What is the laser output radiation used in NIF, and how is it converted
 first to UV and then to x-rays?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An infrared laser is amplified to energies where it is the converted to
 an UV beam.
 The UV beam strikes the hohlraum's inner walls and are re-emitted as xrays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series default
 What is the difference between the stellatron and tokamak?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between the two is the geometry of the torus.
 The stellatron manipulates the magnetic fields with external currents while
 the tokamak manipulates it by driving a current through the plasma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\series default
 Explain the meaning and significance of the Lawson criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lawson criterion states that for a fusion reactor to reach ignition,
 the temperature of the plasma heated by the products of the fusion reaction
 must by high enough to maintain the temperature of the plasma.

What is the source of the forces stabilizing the size of the very massive
 star at various stages of its existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a normal star hydrogen fusion provides an outward pressure which is balanced
 by the inward gravitational force.
 During the red giant phase the star expands because in addition to fusion
 in the core, there is fusion in the shells.
 As a white dwarf the star has collected too much mass, collapses on itself,
 and is held 'up' by electron degeneracy pressure caused by the Pauli exclusion
 principle.
 The star resists further compression because all the lower energy electron
 states are filled.
\end_layout

 Explain the conditions necessary for the processes leading to the production
 of elements heavier than iron to take place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make elements heavier than iron you need a red giant to go supernova.
 In the explosion the neutron densities are theoretically high enough to
 form the heavier elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem*

\series default
 Describe the idea of the Pound and Rebka experimental measurement of gravitatio
nal redshift (1960).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A photon falling moving in a gravitational field will have its frequency
 shifted (blueshifted if towards the center and redshifted if away).
 Atoms will emit photons of a very specific frequency and can only absorb
 photons of a very specific frequency since the energy levels are discrete.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take two radioactive cobalt atoms.
 These atoms emit high energy gamma photons and have sharp spectral lines.
 One of these atoms will emit a photon which can be absorbed by the other.
 In a gravitational field, this photon is slightly shifted, and, since the
 energy levels are discrete, the 'absorber' cannot absorb the photon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the emitter is on the ground, photons emitted upward will be redshifted.
 If the absorber moves towards the source, the photon is blueshifted in
 the absorber's reference frame, by the special relativistic doppler effect.
 These two effects can cancel out the shift, and the photon can be absorbed.
 Measuring the speed necessary for this to happen lets you calculate the
 gravitational frequency shift, validating a prediction of general relativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Atoms that emit photons will experience recoil to conserve momentum.
 Since the frequency shift is so tiny in the tower that Pound and Rebka
 did their experiment in, this recoil causes a doppler shift which to counteract
 would require a shift many orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational
 shift.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By embedding the cobalt atoms in a lattice of iron atoms, the cobalt emits
 photons virtually recoil-free, since the lattice as a whole absorbs the
 recoil.
 This is called the Mossbauer effect.
 Taking all this into account Pound and Rebka were able to find a measurement
 that agreed within 10% of the prediction, and in subsequent experiments
 the accuracy was increased to better than 1%.
